[Is it common for someone with ADHD to breakdown from time to time? Or is it not related to the condition at all?][quora 链接]
##### adhd 患者是不是经常崩溃，还是这跟 adhd症状没关系？
How can I learn to distinguish my personality from my illness? I also have social anxiety. Can it be due to this? It is embarrassing to cry for no reason.
##### 我如何辨别我的性格和病症呢？我还有社交焦虑。这是 adhd 引起的吗？无故的哭泣挺尴尬的。

I think the thing that is important to remember, at least for me, is your disease is your personality.
我认为有一件谨记的事——你的病症就是你的性格——至少对我来说是这样。
I personally don’t like to think of it as a disease at all. I love having ADHD. I mean, it does come with some major obstacles, but you learn to work around it. You figure out the things that work for you and the things that don’t and you adjust your world and you environment to allow you the most success possible. I don’t mean monetary success, I mean life success.
我个人真真不喜欢把它当做一种病，我热爱我的 ADHD。它的确带来了一些困难障碍，但是你学习如何与之相处，调整策略、对你有效的事物和你的环境，来让你更成功。我指的不是金钱上的成功，是生活上的成功。
Look at the times when you are breaking down. What are some similarities?
回忆一下你崩溃的时候。有什么共性吗？
For me, having structures in place allows me to bounce back from those “breakdown” moments much faster. I have found that even if I don’t have the outlet in place right at that moment, the ideal outlet, knowing that it is nearby helps me.
对我来说，原地条理化会让我从这些崩溃中爬起来的更快。我发现即使当时我没有找到出口，理想的出口就在附近的信念能帮助我。
Example: I use working out as my ritalin. There are some times that I get so busy that I am not able to run on a morning that I normally would. But because I have systems in place (running certain days, working out most days, meditation, reflection, etc) I know that my “release” is just around the corner, and that is comforting even if I am not actually running.
举例：我把锻炼当成我的利他林药物。有些时候我太忙，不能如常晨跑。但是我有合适的制度（在特定的日子跑步，大部分时间锻炼，冥想，反省，等等）我知道我会在转角口释放，这回让我在没有跑步的时候，倍感抚慰。
I absolutely think that social anxiety is part of your ADHD. I mean, once something is in your head and on your mind, it feels like it’s superglued!
我绝对认为社交焦虑是你 ADHD 的一部分。就是一旦你想到某些事情，你的脑子僵住了。
I would really look in to meditation. Find routines and structures for your day that allow you to be more comfortable. I highly recommend reading The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin. He basically guides you through the process of reflecting on yourself and creating a healthy mindset to take on challenges and persevere.
我真的会去冥想。找到能让自己舒适的日常节律和节奏。我非常推荐一本书Josh Waitzkin的《学习的艺术》。他引导你进行自我反省，塑造一个健康的观念去迎接挑战，并持之以恒。
Also, you may want to look in to some Stoic philosophies about embracing discomfort, and using it to show you that YOU can make it through.
也许你想寻觅一些拥抱清苦，禁欲修行的哲学来证明你能抗住。
A lot of my ADHD success has come through embracing weaknesses and focusing on strengths. It is a tamable fire, but a fire nonetheless.
我的许多 ADHD 的成功是通过拥抱弱点，着重于强项 得来的。它是可以驯服的火，然而它还是火。
Please feel free to contact me directly if I did not go in to enough detail on anything. I want to point in the right direction without going crazy!
如果有任何事情没解释清楚，请直接联系我！我希望我能不发疯地 指出正确的方向！

Good luck!
祝好运！
Love your ADHD!
热爱你的 ADHD ！
